# 50m Rifle 3P FINAL — workflow map and roadmap (design doc)

Single-athlete **Finals Training Mode** for one TechAim lane unit, implementing
the 50m Rifle 3-Positions Final per the **ISSF Rule Book 2026 Edition 2025,
Second Print 07/2026, effective 1 July 2026**, as a training simulation.

**Everything here is gated on `isFinalsMatch` and is a fully separate domain**
from 3P qualification (`is3PMatch`, `docs/3p-discipline.md`), 50m Prone, the
air disciplines, and the future RMS multi-athlete final. Finals is NOT
implemented by scattering if-statements through qualification code: it has a
dedicated controller (below). Approved for implementation 2026-07-12 with the
clarifications integrated below. Items marked **[P1 — UNRESOLVED]** are
disabled by default until confirmed.

## Architecture: dedicated finals controller

```
src/finals/
    Finals3PController.h/.cpp   — QObject state machine, single time authority
    Finals3PTypes.h             — stage/window/command enums, event structs
    Finals3PConfig.h            — configuration (ceremonyMode, flags, timeScale)
```

Exposed to QML as the `FINALS3P` context property. The shooting page **binds**
to the controller; it never owns finals timing logic.

Main API: `startFinal() / skipCeremony() / setTargetMode(Sighter|Match) /
registerShot(shot) / abortFinal() / pauseTrainingSimulation() /
resumeTrainingSimulation()`.
Signals: `phaseChanged / commandIssued / countdownChanged / shotAccepted /
shotRejected / stageCompleted / finalCompleted`.

### Timer architecture (single time authority)

No web of loosely coordinated QML Timers. The controller owns one **monotonic
clock** (`QElapsedTimer`); a 50–100 ms UI tick recomputes
`remaining = duration − monotonicElapsed` — never a once-per-second integer
decrement (UI stalls must not drift the clock). Exposed: `remainingMs`,
`remainingFormatted`, `elapsedMs`, `isFiringWindowOpen`.
Developer-only accelerated mode `timeScale` (1.0 normal, e.g. 60.0 for tests)
— never exposed in production UI.
RMS hooks so a server can later replace the local time authority:
`startPhaseFromServer(cmd) / stopPhaseFromServer(cmd) /
synchroniseClock(serverTimestamp, offset) / applyAuthoritativeState(snapshot)`.

### Command events

Every CRO command is a **structured event**, not just text:
`FinalsCommandEvent { commandId, commandType, text, issuedAt, effectiveAt,
stage, sequenceNumber, audioCueId }`, with command types
`AthletesToLine, TakeYourPositions, PreparationSightingStart, ThirtySeconds,
Stop, StageOneAnnouncement, MatchFiringStart, FiveMinutes, LoadSeries,
StartSeries, LoadSingle, StartSingle, Unload, ResultsFinal` — essential for
RMS integration and audio playback.

### Audio

Phase A baseline: on-screen command text + system beep + structured
`audioCueId` emitted. The state machine is **decoupled from any voice engine**
via `FinalsAudioService { playCue(cueId), stop(), isAvailable }`; Phase D may
implement prerecorded WAV clips or Qt TextToSpeech. The machine works
identically without voice.

## Scope decisions (locked)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| 1 | Single athlete, one unit, **full 35-shot program**. No ranking, elimination, tie-breaking or penalties — RMS territory. Elimination points are announced as **information only**. |
| 2 | The **app plays the CRO**: auto-running timers issue the commands with voice/beep cues. |
| 3 | Ceremony simulated, configurable `ceremonyMode: Full | Short | Skip`. |
| 4 | Stage 1: the **athlete switches the target Match↔Sighter on screen**; legal transitions enforced; the software never auto-switches prone/standing sighting back to MATCH without athlete confirmation. |
| 5 | **Decimal scoring only**, start-from-zero, cumulative. |
| 6 | Penalties out of scope until asked. |
| 7 | Entry point: **"FINAL (35)"** event card in the 50m Rifle → 3 Positions flow. |
| 8 | Report: finals-specific data model (below). |
| 9 | Large dedicated shot-time countdown always visible during timed fire; voice counter later. |
| 10 | `stopSeriesWhenAthleteCompletes: true` for training (a real CRO waits for all finalists; the RMS server will own that later). |

## The 35-shot program (shot accounting)

| Shots | Stage | Time authority |
|---|---|---|
| 1–10 | Kneeling match | shared 22:00 Stage-1 clock, athlete-paced |
| 11–20 | Prone match | same 22:00 clock |
| 21–25 | Standing Series 1 | 250 s, on command |
| 26–30 | Standing Series 2 | 250 s, on command |
| 31–35 | Standing Singles 1–5 | 50 s each, on command |

Official numbering is continuous 1–35; **sighting shots never consume official
shot numbers**. Stage enum:

```
FinalsStage { Ceremony, KneelingPrepSight, KneelingMatch, ProneSighting,
              ProneMatch, StandingSighting, StandingSeries1, StandingSeries2,
              StandingSingle1..StandingSingle5, Complete, Aborted }
```

Each accepted match shot carries: `finalShotNumber, stage, position,
seriesIndex, shotWithinStage, decimalScore, xMm, yMm, timestamp,
phaseStartTimestamp, timeUsedInWindow, commandWindowId, targetModeAtReceipt,
accepted/rejected status`. Model roles are finals-specific
(`finalsStageId, finalsStageLabel, finalsShotNumber, finalsWindowId`) — not
overloaded onto the qualification `position` role. Because ListModel role sets
lock at first append, **every finals role is declared in the first inserted
record**.

## State machine

```
IDLE ── startFinal()
CEREMONY (ceremonyMode: Full = intro + hold · Short = hold only · Skip = none)
 ├─ "ATHLETES TO THE LINE", athlete introduction        [Full]
 ├─ "TAKE YOUR POSITIONS" → 30 s kneeling hold          [Full/Short]
 │    holding/aiming allowed; dry firing and safety-flag removal PROHIBITED
 │    (the 30 s hold is NOT part of the 5-minute timer)
KNEELING PREP+SIGHT — 5:00, window SightingOpen
 ├─ "FIVE MINUTES PREPARATION AND SIGHTING TIME…START"
 ├─ 4:30 → "30 SECONDS" · 5:00 → "STOP", window Closed
 └─ software auto-switches target to MATCH (= EST Technical Officer role).
     This is the ONLY automatic Match switch in the final.
STAGE 1 — one continuous 22:00 clock (never paused/restarted by changeovers)
 ├─ "FINALISTS HAVE TWENTY-TWO MINUTES…" → +5 s → "MATCH FIRING START"
 ├─ KneelingMatch  shots 1–10  (max 10, window MatchOpen)
 ├─ athlete: flags in, change to prone, taps SIGHT → ProneSighting (unlimited)
 ├─ athlete taps MATCH → ProneMatch  shots 11–20 (max 10)
 ├─ athlete: change to standing, taps SIGHT → StandingSighting (unlimited,
 │    in whatever time remains)
 ├─ elapsed 17:00 → "FIVE MINUTES" · 21:30 → "THIRTY SECONDS"
 └─ 22:00 → "STOP", window Closed. Standing target must be in MATCH before
     the first commanded series (athlete confirms; prompt if still SIGHT).
STANDING SERIES n = 1, 2
 ├─ gap/announcer period → "FOR THE NEXT COMPETITION SERIES…LOAD" → 5 s →
 │   "START" → window MatchOpen, 250 s countdown
 ├─ close on 5 accepted shots (stopSeriesWhenAthleteCompletes) or 250 s
 └─ "STOP", stage completion stored. After series 2: info notice
     "8th and 7th places would be eliminated here".
STANDING SINGLES k = 31…35
 ├─ "FOR THE NEXT COMPETITION SHOT…LOAD" → 5 s → "START" → one-shot window,
 │   50 s countdown, always-visible
 ├─ close on 1 accepted shot or 50 s → "STOP"
 └─ info notices: after 31 → 6th · 32 → 5th · 33 → 4th · 34 → bronze decided ·
     35 → silver and gold decided (informational only — no rank assumptions)
COMPLETE — "STOP…UNLOAD" → "RESULTS ARE FINAL" → finals report available
```

### Firing-window gating

Explicit window states `Closed | SightingOpen | MatchOpen`:
- **SightingOpen** → append to `globalSlighterModel`; official total unaffected.
- **MatchOpen** → validate stage limit, append to `globalMatchModel`, update
  cumulative decimal total.
- **Closed** → reject official registration, log, show
  "SHOT OUTSIDE FIRING WINDOW".
A unique local shot/event id guards against the same raw event being appended
twice on hardware retry.

### Extra-shot blocking

Hard limits: Kneeling 10 · Prone 10 · each series 5 · each single window 1.
An extra shot is **never silently ignored**: it is excluded from the official
model, logged as `ShotRejected { reason: StageShotLimitReached, stage,
rawShot, timestamp }`, surfaced as a clear warning, with raw coordinates
retained for diagnostics.

### [P1 — UNRESOLVED] Unfired shots at window expiry

`fillUnfiredShotsWithZero: false` (default, and Phase B ships with it off).
When a timed stage expires: close the window, preserve the actual shots fired,
mark the stage incomplete, and record `MissingShot { expectedShotNumber,
stage, reason: TimeExpired }` — **no synthetic shot records are inserted into
`globalMatchModel`**. The report may display
"Shot 24 — DNS / Not fired — 0.0 provisional", but the raw model always
distinguishes a missing shot from a detected one. Final behaviour to be
confirmed against the rule interpretation and desired training feel.

## Display rules

Finals UI is clearly distinct from qualification: **FINAL 35** event label ·
decimal-only scores · continuous shot number 1–35 · current stage + position ·
target mode (SIGHTER/MATCH) · command banner · large remaining-time display ·
firing-window status · stage subtotal · cumulative total · phase stepper:

```
PREP · KNEEL · PRONE · STAND SIGHT · S1 · S2 · 31 · 32 · 33 · 34 · 35 · DONE
```

Standing singles 31–35 are **normal commanded final shots** — the label
"SHOOT-OFF" is reserved for future tie-breaking shots (RMS phase) and must not
be used for the single-shot progression.

## Report

`FinalsReportData` (finals-specific — none of the qualification assumptions:
no six 10-shot series, no integer-primary totals, no qualification position
grouping, no 60-shot completion rules; visual components may be reused):
athlete · event · date/time · completion status · cumulative decimal total ·
Kneeling subtotal (10 expected) · Prone subtotal (10 expected) · Series 1 and
Series 2 subtotals (5 expected each) · singles 31–35 individually · missing
shots · rejected/out-of-window incidents · shot-by-shot time used · target
plots · stage timeline.

## Persistence and recovery (lands with Phase B)

After each accepted shot and phase transition, persist: `isFinalsMatch`,
current stage, stage start time, accepted shots, sighting shots, command
sequence, target mode, cumulative total, missing-shot records, completion
status. On restart: offer **Resume Final** or explicitly mark the interrupted
final abandoned — never silently restart at zero while retaining old shots.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| **A** | Skeleton only — **no shot scoring changes**: FINAL (35) event entry, finals session flag, dedicated controller, complete state machine, phase transitions, countdown framework, command events, command banner, phase stepper, beep fallback, dry-run controls, abort/reset, RMS `FromServer` hooks, developer `timeScale`. Tests verify: state sequence, command order, warning timing, 5-s LOAD→START delay, 22-min warnings, two 250-s series, five 50-s singles, completion, no qualification-timer usage, no shot totals affected. |
| **B** | Stage-1 shot handling: window gating into the models, 10+10 enforcement, SIGHT/MATCH legality, decimal totals, persistence/recovery, [P1] left disabled. |
| **C** | Standing series + singles shot handling with the LOAD/START/STOP cadence. |
| **D** | Finals report + audio implementation (WAV clips or TextToSpeech behind FinalsAudioService) + ceremony polish. |
| **E** | RMS (separate software): ranking, eliminations, tie-breaking, penalties, range-wide control. |

Phase A commit plan on `feature/3p-finals` (no Phase B work mixed in):
**A1** finals types, controller and configuration · **A2** event entry and
finals UI skeleton · **A3** timers, commands, stepper and accelerated test
mode · **A4** Phase-A test suite and documentation update.

## Phase A — IMPLEMENTED (commits A1 `07b8527`, A2+A3 `c707611`, A4)

What exists and is verified:

- `src/finals/` controller domain registered as `FINALS3P`; the **FINAL (35)**
  event card appears only in the 50m Rifle → 3 Positions flow; selecting it
  hands the session to the finals controller — the qualification prep/sighting
  machinery and timers never run (`isFinalsMatch` forces `is3PMatch` false).
- Finals panel on the shooting page: stepper, command banner, large countdown,
  window/target-mode status, next official shot number, and dry-run controls
  (SIGHT/MATCH, SKIP CEREMONY, PAUSE/RESUME, ABORT, RESET). In demo mode a
  click on the target drives `FINALS3P.simulateShot()` — the real acceptance
  path with **no scoring and no model writes** (every Phase-A shot event is
  flagged `simulated`; structurally the controller has no access to
  `globalMatchModel`/`globalSlighterModel` or any qualification timer).
- **Acceptance test suite: `tests/finals/` — 70 checks, 0 failures.**
  Standalone console harness (`qmake finals_tests.pro`, run with the Qt bin
  directory on PATH). Runs the controller end-to-end at
  `TECHAIM_FINALS_TIMESCALE=60` and asserts: the exact command-event ordering
  (all 39 commands from ATHLETES TO THE LINE to RESULTS ARE FINAL) and exact
  stage-entry ordering; ceremony Full/Short/Skip; the 30 s hold separate from
  the 5:00 prep timer; prep 4:30 warning; auto-MATCH only at prep end; the
  continuous 22:00 Stage-1 clock with 17:00/21:30 warnings; athlete
  SIGHT/MATCH legality (legal and illegal transitions); both 250 s series and
  all five 50 s singles with the 5 s LOAD→START delay each; continuous
  numbering 1–35 with sighters unnumbered; per-stage limits + rejection events
  (11th shot, out-of-window); elimination info notices in sequence; final
  STOP→UNLOAD→RESULTS ARE FINAL order; pause freezing remaining time; abort →
  Aborted; reset → Idle; repeated/invalid commands harmless; RMS hook stubs
  callable without state damage; no synthetic shots at window expiry
  ([P1] disabled).
- Timing assertions use a tolerance of a few controller ticks (50 ms real ×
  timeScale), since scaled time advances in tick-sized steps; ordering
  assertions are exact.

Phase B starts from here: window gating into the real shot models, decimal
totals, persistence/recovery — [P1] to be reconfirmed first.
**Phase-B implementation plan: `docs/3p-finals-phase-b-plan.md`** (approved
plan required before Phase-B code; the Stage-1 transition mechanism and [P1]
are the two review gates).
